## Election_Analysis

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to find the results of the County Election using Python and Visual Studio Code and to aslo determine:

•	The voter turnout for each county

•	The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count

•	The county with the highest turnout

After reading and extracting data from CSV files. Declaring variables using different data types, creating data structures like lists and dictionaries, writing data to an output file, and printing the file, I got the results of the elections.

## Winner: Diana DeGette with winning percentage of 73.8% and 272,892 votes
## And the county with the largest votes is Denver which recieved 82.8% and 306.055 votes

####   Python and Visual Studio Code were great applications to use to determine the results of the elections since there were thousands of votes.  Within seconds, it got the results of thousands of votes within the counties.  I recommend using this method and these applications for future elections because it helps.  I recommend an expert data analyst using these types of applications because they can navigate through them faster.
